# Optimal-Control-of-a-Vehicle
The objective of this project is to design the optimal control law of a fictitious bicycle. In order to absolve this tasks, the trajectories of the bicycle
must be optimized through the Newtonâ€™s method algorithm. Then an optimal feedback controller has to be defined using the LQR (Linear Quadratic
Regulator) algorithm. An additional constrain for the input control is added
in order to simulate input saturation. Finally, the bicycle movement will be
shown in an animation.


[OPTCON2022} Group 19 - Alma Mater Studiorum UNIBO - Execution of the code:

-Task_1: Open file 'Task_1-2.py'
	In order to launch this task, you have to select 'Step' curve in "TO DO section".
	To visualize the Armijo's plot set to True the flag 'visu-armijo'

-Task_2: Open file 'Task_1-2.py'
	In order to launch this task, you have to select 'Skidpad' curve in "TO DO section".
	To visualize the Armijo's plot set to True the flag 'visu-armijo'

-Task_3: Open file 'Task_3-4.py'
	Is possibile to select between 'Step' and 'Skidpad' which trajectory will be tracked.

-Task_4: Open file 'Task_3-4.py'
	Is possibile to select between 'Step' and 'Skidpad' which trajectory will be tracked.
	The animation will start automatically at the end of the execution.

-Task_5: Open file 'Task_1-2-5.py'
	In order to launch this task, you have to select between 'Step' and 'Skidpad' curve in "TO DO section".
	Automatically some constrain in the input control are set, is possible to see the output degradation.
